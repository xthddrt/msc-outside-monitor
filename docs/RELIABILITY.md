# Reliability audit

This document records the defects found in the driver while investigating host
bugchecks, and what was changed. It is an audit trail, not a claim that the
driver is production ready. Every item below still needs the VM procedure in
`TEST_VM.md`, ideally under Driver Verifier with `/standard /all`, plus
`/em` applied to non-Microsoft drivers when the build is test-signed.

## Fatal on driver stop / unload

### 1. Load-image notification was never removed

`MsMonProcessUninitialize` called `PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine(MsMonImageNotify)`
a second time to "unregister" the callback. The removal API is
`PsRemoveLoadImageNotifyRoutine`. Windows rejects a duplicate registration, so
the routine stayed in the kernel's notification list, pointing into a driver
image that was about to be unmapped.

Effect: the next image load anywhere on the system (any DLL in any process)
jumps into unmapped code. This shows up as a fault in an unloaded module
(`PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA`, `IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL`), or under Driver
Verifier as `0xC4` with the "driver unloaded without cancelling a notification
routine" subcode.

Fixed in `driver/process.c`.

### 2. Unload while a collector was blocked in `MSMON_IOCTL_READ_EVENTS`

The read IOCTL sleeps up to one second waiting for events. Nothing made
`DriverUnload` wait for that in-flight IRP or wake it, so the device object was
deleted while a dispatch routine was still executing, and teardown raced with a
live `gQueue`. This is `0xCE` `DRIVER_UNLOADED_WITHOUT_CANCELLING_PENDING_OPERATIONS`,
the signature reported for this driver.

Fixed with an `EX_RUNDOWN_REF` around every dispatch plus an explicit wake:
after waking readers, unload calls `ExWaitForRundownProtectionRelease` (which
refuses new acquisitions and blocks until the in-flight IRPs finish) and only
then `ExRundownCompleted`, which is the documented order
(`driver/driver.c`, `driver/events.c`). Session stop also wakes readers.

### 3. Minifilter could be detached twice

`MsMonFilterUnload` returned `STATUS_SUCCESS`, so `fltmc unload` detached the
filter while the driver kept running. The later `FltUnregisterFilter` in
`DriverUnload` then operated on an already-unregistered filter. The filter is
part of a multi-purpose legacy driver and cannot be detached alone, so the
callback now returns `STATUS_FLT_DO_NOT_DETACH`.

## Runtime stability

### 4. WFP call made while holding a spin lock

`MsMonAssociateFlow` called `FwpsFlowAssociateContext0` with `gFlowLock` held.
The flow-delete callback (`MsMonWfpFlowDelete`) is invoked by WFP holding its
own internal flow lock and takes `gFlowLock`. The two lock orders are opposite,
which is a hard deadlock at `DISPATCH_LEVEL` (typically `CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT`
or a frozen machine) whenever a flow is torn down while another is being
associated.

WFP is now called without the lock, and the context is linked afterwards.

### 5. WFP teardown order and ignored unregister status

Flow contexts were freed after `FwpmEngineClose`, and
`FwpsCalloutUnregisterById` failures were ignored while the driver cleared its
own bookkeeping. A callout that fails to unregister still points at the driver
image after unload.

Flow contexts are now removed before the engine closes, and the registered flag
is cleared only when unregistration actually succeeds (failure is reported with
`DbgPrint`). The `...ById0` variant is used with the `FWPS_CALLOUT3`
registration.

### 6. Unchecked WFP field indexing

The callout indexed `InFixedValues->incomingValue[]` with hard-coded layer field
ids. It now verifies every field id against `valueCount` before use, and checks
`Filter`, `InFixedValues`, `InMetaValues`, `ClassifyOut` for `NULL`.

### 7. File-name queries at unsafe IRQL and in post-create

* `FltGetFileNameInformation` is documented for `IRQL <= APC_LEVEL`. Paging I/O
  and some cleanup paths can reach a minifilter above that, so every call is now
  IRQL guarded.
* Create names were queried from the post-operation callback with
  `FLT_FILE_NAME_QUERY_DEFAULT`, which may issue file-system I/O from a
  post-create path and is not valid when the create failed. Names are now
  resolved in a pre-create callback (the documented place) and the post-create
  path only reads the cached result, applies `FltGetTunneledName`, and releases
  it. `Parameters.Create.SecurityContext` is read only when the create
  succeeded.
* `IRP_MJ_READ` / `IRP_MJ_WRITE` registrations now set
  `FLTFL_OPERATION_REGISTRATION_SKIP_PAGING_IO`; a telemetry filter has no
  reason to observe paging I/O, and that path is both the highest risk and the
  highest volume.
* Post-operation callbacks skip all work when
  `FLTFL_POST_OPERATION_DRAINING` is set.

### 8. Volume-information capture used unsupported buffer APIs

`IRP_MJ_QUERY_VOLUME_INFORMATION` is not one of the operations
`FltLockUserBuffer` supports, and the code called it (and
`FltDecodeParameters`) from a post-operation callback, then dereferenced the
result as a kernel pointer. For a user-mode requestor the buffer is a user
address, and a post-operation callback can run in a different process context,
so that was a wild kernel read.

The capture now reads `Parameters.QueryVolumeInformation.VolumeBuffer`
directly, requires `IRQL == PASSIVE_LEVEL`, requires the requesting process to
be the current process for user addresses, probes user addresses, guards the
copy with `SEH`, caps the copy at 1 KiB, and records `payload_unavailable` with
a reason otherwise.

## Bounds and teardown hardening

### 9. Unbounded payload chunking

One registry value could turn into thousands of 8 KiB records of nonpaged pool
(and a stalled registry callback). Registry values are captured up to 64 KiB
and larger values are reported as incomplete (`MsMonFlagPayloadPartial`);
`MsMonLogPayloadSeries` rejects operations above 8 MiB / 1024 chunks.

### 10. Teardown of uninitialised subsystems

If an early `DriverEntry` step failed, the cleanup path still called teardown
for the process tracker and the event queue, which used an uninitialised
`KMUTEX` and list head. Both now have an initialised flag and return early.

### 11. Missing NULL checks in the object post-operation callback

`OB_POST_OPERATION_INFORMATION.Parameters` and `Object` are now checked before
use, and the allocated call context is freed on every path.

### 12. `RtlStringCchPrintfW` in the WFP classify path

Observed 2026-10-29: bugcheck `0xA` (`IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL`) seconds after a
tracked client opened its first connection. Stack: `msmon!MsMonWfpClassify` ->
`MsMonFormatIpv4` -> `RtlStringCchPrintfW` -> `nt!vsnwprintf` ->
`nt!RtlAnsiCharToUnicodeChar` -> `nt!RtlpIsUtf8Process`, faulting on a
user-mode address in an unrelated process (`mscorsvw.exe`).

Classify runs at `DISPATCH_LEVEL` in arbitrary thread context. The ntstrsafe
printf family is `PASSIVE_LEVEL` only: the kernel CRT widens formatted digits
through `RtlAnsiCharToUnicodeChar`, which reads the current process's PEB. The
path was latent until new-process tracking worked, because classify returns
before formatting for untracked processes.

Fix: classify builds address and endpoint text by hand (`MsMonAppendText`,
`MsMonAppendUnsigned`). No printf remains on a `DISPATCH_LEVEL` path. The object
post-operation callback also now calls `SeLocateProcessImageName` only at
`PASSIVE_LEVEL`, since post-operation callbacks can run at `APC_LEVEL`.

### 13. Network endpoints logged with reversed addresses and swapped ports

WFP supplies IPv4 addresses and ports in host byte order. The classify path
printed the least significant octet first and byte-swapped both ports, so
`172.16.1.118:61399 -> 35.164.63.25:443` was logged as
`118.1.16.172:55279 -> 25.63.164.35:47873`. Both are now printed as supplied.

### 14. Empty registry values reported as `invalid_value_offset`

For `KeyValueFullInformation`, an empty value's `DataOffset` need not lie inside
the returned buffer, so a successful query was logged as unavailable. A
zero-length value is now logged as an empty capture.

### 15. BlackCat was never detected

`MsMonBlackCatName` compared the `.sys` suffix with a loop that also visited the
string terminator, where its `'\0'` check returned `FALSE`, so no module name
ever matched: `blackcat_loaded` was never logged and `blackcat_matches` stayed
0. The suffix is now compared and the terminator required separately. The
load-image callback also records BlackCat's range when the driver loads, so
operations from its `DriverEntry` are attributable, and attributed events carry
the loaded image's real name (`BlackCat1.sys`) instead of a fixed
`BlackCat64.sys`.

### 16. NGS service outside the tracked scope

The NGS security service runs `%ProgramData%\Nexon\NGS\NGService.exe` and is
started by the service control manager, so it was neither under the client
scope nor a tracked descendant. The session configuration now carries up to
three extra roots (older agents send the shorter structure and still work), and
the agent adds the NGS folder by default.

## Collector throughput

Observed 2026-10-29: 288,348 driver events dropped in one game session, 95% of
the client's `file_read` events during its start-up burst. The agent read the
driver queue on the same thread that decoded, hashed and wrote every record,
so the 16,384-record queue overflowed. The agent now drains the driver on a
dedicated thread into a pageable buffer (256 MB limit, peak and back-pressure
reported in the `driver_pump` coverage record), the default queue is the
32,768-record maximum, and the log chain hashes with the one-shot `BCryptHash`
instead of opening a provider per record. A 250,000-read burst in 2 seconds
was then logged with no drops (peak buffer 46.6 MB).

The next game session still lost 26,825 events (26,697 `file_read`) in a single
gap during the 62,000-77,000 events/s load peak, which ended as BlackCat
finished loading. Synthetic bursts of 230,000 reads/s did not reproduce it.
Device handles are synchronous, so the reader's reads queued behind the main
thread's once-per-second module refresh, which waits for the kernel's
loaded-module lock while a 5 MB driver is being loaded and verified. The
reader now opens its own handle and runs at `THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST`, and the
queue record limit is 131,072 so the 64 MB byte limit, not the count, bounds
the driver queue (about 1.7 s at the observed peak instead of 0.4 s). The
writer sustains roughly 70,000 events/s; larger bursts are absorbed by the
256 MB reader buffer before back-pressure reaches the driver.

## Not changed

* Full-payload registry and volume capture is still the default; logs still
  contain identifiers and secrets.
* `MsMonCurrentIsBlackCat` still walks the kernel stack for every event while a
  BlackCat image is loaded. That is a deliberate accuracy/cost trade-off; it is
  expensive under heavy file I/O and shows up as throughput loss, not as a
  crash.
* The `compat/` legacy driver is untouched. Its inline hooks remain disabled.
* No packet payload, file content, or TLS capture is added.

## Suggested verification

1. Load, start the agent, then `sc stop msmon` **while the agent is still
   running**. No bugcheck, no hung unload.
2. Repeat start/stop ten times, including with `fltmc unload msmon` attempted
   (it must fail with `FLT_DO_NOT_DETACH`).
3. Exercise the game's connect/accept path heavily and stop the driver while
   flows are open.
4. Query volume information from a tracked process and from an unrelated
   process; confirm the payload matches and that the foreign-context case is
   recorded as unavailable.
5. Run Driver Verifier with `/standard /all` and `/em` for `msmon.sys` through
   the checklist in `TEST_VM.md`.
