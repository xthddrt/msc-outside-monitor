 * Socket tags (foundation; shared by the tcp and packets upgrades, owned by neither: change it only
 * through the plan). Every INET/INET6 socket a tracked process creates, connects, sends or receives
 * on gets one mm_sock in socket-local storage: freed with the socket, and BPF_F_CLONE copies a
 * listener's tag to each socket accept() will return. Readers (tcp.bpf.h in softirq, pkt.bpf.h in
 * cgroup_skb) look the tag up without creating one, so untagged sockets cost one lookup.
 *
 * Under Wine the maker is wineserver (it does socket()/connect()/accept() for its clients) and the
 * owner is the game process that then sends and receives on the socket itself.
